<Aside type="caution">
Many issues require the help of moderators to solve. Please understand that the moderators are providing support free-of-charge and in their free time. They are doing their best to help you, but sometimes it can take a while until they can respond to you. There are typically hundreds of open tickets at any given time, so *please be patient* and do not create multiple tickets. A moderator will respond to your ticket *as soon as possible*.

## 1. Registration & Migration

### 1.1 What is "KoG 2.0" and why is a "Migration" neccessary?

With the introduction of <nobr>KoG 2.0</nobr> we have implemented a new system that ensures players are not only tied to their <nobr>"KoG identity"</nobr> by means of their in-game nickname. In the past, any maps you finished and points you collected were only tied to your in-game nickname. We now have a system in place that allows you to create an account on our website and link it to your in-game nickname. The migration process is necessary to link your in-game nickname to your new account.

This also allows us to moderate the KoG servers more effectively. For example, it ensures that others cannot simply impersonate you by using your in-game nickname and get you banned, since they cannot login with your account.

During the migration process an AI will analyze your gameplay from previous sessions on KoG servers and check for any abnormalities. This will help us exclude botters and cheaters to maintain the competitive integrity of the servers and ensure a fair and fun experience for everyone.

<Aside type="caution">
Never share your account/login code with other players. Account sharing is *not allowed* and will get you banned.
</Aside>

### 1.2 How can I start playing on KoG servers?

If you have never played on KoG servers before, please ensure that you're using an in-game nickname that has not been used before. You can check this by connecting to a KoG server that does not include "[A]" in the server name and using the `/points` command. If you already have points, but never finished a map before, it means that someone else has been using your in-game nickname before. In this case, you should choose a different in-game nickname.

If you have played on KoG servers before and have points, you can start the migration process by following the instructions on the [Registration & Migration](/information/registration/) page.

<Aside>
You may need to finish several maps and gather points on your chosen in-game nickname before you can begin the migration process. This is necessary to ensure that the AI has enough data to analyze your gameplay and detect any abnormalities.

See also: [4.2 I cannot create an account, it says: “Please finish a map on non [A] servers first before registering.”](/information/faq/#42-i-cannot-create-an-account-it-says-please-finish-a-map-on-non-a-servers-first-before-registering)
</Aside>

### 1.3 Why should I register an account?

There are many benefits to playing with an account, for example:

- If you play on non "[A]" servers, you cannot be funvoted by players who are not logged in
- If a player who is logged in funvotes you or is otherwise disruptive, moderators can take action against them more easily
- You can join "[A]" servers and play with other verified players

### 1.4 How long does it take to migrate?

The migration process typically takes anywhere from a couple of hours to several days, depending on how much data you have generated from previous gameplay on KoG servers and whether any abnormalities in your gameplay were detected.

### 1.5 How can I check the status of my migration?

You can follow the steps below to check the status of your migration:

<Steps>
1. Open [kog.tw](https://kog.tw/) in your browser
2. Click on "Login" in the top right corner and sign-in
3. Click on "Start/check migration" within the red banner at the top of the page
</Steps>

The current status of your migration should now show up. If your migration has finished, you should see a green banner containing the following message: 

> Your account has been successfully migrated, welcome to KoG 2.0!

Afterwards you can click on "Click here to generate the code" to generate a new login code that you can use in-game to login and play on "[A]" servers.

You can login in-game using the <nobr>`/login [code]`</nobr> command. Alternatively, you can create a keybind to login with a single key press by using the command <nobr>`bind l "login [code]"`</nobr>. To do this, open the console in-game by pressing `F1` and paste the command there. You can adjust the keybind by changing the character `l` to any other key.

### 1.6 Why does my migration need a manual review?

During the migration process, an AI analyzes your gameplay from previous sessions on KoG servers and checks for any abnormalities. In some cases the AI may detect behavior that is very similar to known cheats or bots, but the AI can not conclusively determine whether you were cheating or not. In these cases, your migration will be flagged for manual review by a moderator.

### 1.7 My migration status says that I have been banned, what can I do?

You can try to appeal your case and it will be reviewed by the moderation team.

To do this, please open the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel in our Discord server and use the button "Registration" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you. 

Open this channel and provide the following information:
- Your in-game name
- What happened

The team will review your case internally and get back to you as soon as possible.

## 2. In-game questions

### 2.1 How do I join [A] servers?

Any server with an "[A]" in the server name requires you to have an account and be logged in to play. If you do not wish to create an account, you can still join and play on KoG servers without an "[A]" in the server name.

You can login in-game using the <nobr>`/login [code]`</nobr> command. Alternatively, you can create a keybind to login with a single key press by using the command <nobr>`bind l "login [code]"`</nobr>. To do this, open the console in-game by pressing `F1` and paste the command there. You can adjust the keybind by changing the character `l` to any other key.

If you do not remember your login code, please refer to [4.10 I cannot login on KoG servers, I forgot my login code](/information/faq/#410-i-cannot-login-on-kog-servers-i-forgot-my-login-code) to generate a new login code.

### 2.2 How do I save my progress in a map and load my save later?

It is not possible to save and load your progress without the support of a moderator. You can ask a moderator to help you on our Discord server by pinging them in the [#general_chatroom](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/342003344476471296) using `@Moderator ping`.

In addition to that, saves are usually only enabled for certain maps, such as:

- Fly_to_the_mix
- Himalaya
- Himalaya2
- Insaipteleres
- PoiPoi
- TwoFive
- Very long extreme maps

### 2.3 Am I allowed to use other clients when playing on KoG servers?

While we support all standard Teeworlds clients, we focus on having 100% DDNet upstream support. Therefore we highly recommend using one of the following clients:

- [DDNet](https://ddnet.tw/)
- [T-Client](https://tclient.app/)

If you are unsure whether a specific client is allowed, please ask a moderator before using it.

<Aside type="danger">
You are **not allowed** to use clients that contain functionality that gives you an unfair advantage over other players, such as:

- Cheating
- Botting
- Scripting
- Automated advertising of such clients

If you connect to KoG servers using a client that offers these features, you **will be banned on sight**.
</Aside>

## 3. Common questions

### 3.1 How do I get the confirmed role?

First, make sure that you have already registered an account. If you haven't, please check the [Registration & Migration](/information/registration/) page to learn how to this.

Afterwards please open the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel in our Discord server and use the button "`Registration`" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you.

Open this channel and write "`!verify`".

### 3.2 How do I change my username without losing my points?

First, make sure that you meet the criteria for namechanges:

- You must have reached enough points to be in the top 2000 of players
- Your new name must not be taken
- You may only change your name once a year and you may not change back to your original name

You can check your current rank using the `/points` command while on KoG servers. If you'd like to know how many points you need to reach to be in the top 2000 of players, you can use the following command: <nobr>`/top5points 2000`</nobr>.

If you meet these criteria, you can change your name by following these steps:

<Steps>
1. Open [kog.tw](https://kog.tw/) in your browser
2. Click on "Login" in the top right corner and sign-in
3. Click on your username in the top right corner and select "Dashboard"
4. Click on "Your Tickets"
5. Click on "New ticket" and change the type from "Generic" to "Namechange"
6. Fill out the form and click on "Request namechange"
7. Open the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel in our Discord server and use the button "Namechange" to create a new ticket
8. Open this channel and ask a moderator to review your namechange request
</Steps>

### 3.3 How can I report other players for cheating or bad behavior in-game?

To make a report, please open the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel in our Discord server and use the button "Ingame" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you. 

Open this channel and provide the following information:
- Your in-game name
- Your IP address (can be copied from [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/what-is-my-ip))
- The server's IP address
- What happened

Make sure to attach the relevant demo file(s). You can open the directory where the demo files are stored by clicking on the "Demos" button in the main menu of the game. Aftewards click on the "Demos directory" and then navigate to the "auto" directory containing the demo files. 

A moderator will review your case as soon as possible and help you.

### 3.4 I got kicked, but I didn't do anything wrong. What can I do?

Firstly, we highly recommend following the [registration process](/information/registration/) to create your own account. If you're logged in while playing on KoG servers, other players who are not logged in will not be able to funvote you. This will help you avoid getting kicked unfairly.

Funvotes are against [our rules](/information/rules/) and can be reported to moderators. A moderator will review the situation and may take action against the player who funvoted you.

To make a report, please follow the instructions in [3.3 How can I report other players for cheating or bad behavior in-game?](/information/faq/#33-how-can-i-report-other-players-for-cheating-or-bad-behavior-in-game).

### 3.5 I got banned, what can I do?

If you got banned by a moderator (*not* votekicked by players) there is probably a good reason for it. However, you can try to appeal your case and it will be reviewed by the moderation team.

To do this, please open the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel in our Discord server and use the button "Ingame" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you. 

Open this channel and provide the following information:
- Your in-game name
- Your IP address
- The server's IP address
- What happened

The team will review your case internally and get back to you as soon as possible.

<Aside type="caution">
Please do not create multiple tickets and do not spam the moderators. This will not help your case and may result in further action being taken against you.

Please be patient and wait for a moderator to respond to your ticket.
</Aside>

### 3.6 How can I join the KoG clan?

The KoG clan is currently open for applications. To apply, you must meet the following requirements:

- **Rank requirements**
  - Applicants **must be** ranked top 200 or higher on the _fixed points_ leaderboard
- **Personal requirements**
  - We're looking for players who embody the spirit of KoG, which means...
  - ... being **friendly and respectful** towards others
  - ... contributing **positively** to the KoG community — KoG is a place where players encourage and support each other
  - ... maintaining a **non-toxic attitude**

KoG isn't just about skill, it's about being part of a community that thrives on collaboration, respect, and mutual growth.

If you meet these requirements, you may apply for membership by reaching out to the `|*KoG*| Manager` members on our Discord server. Afterwards, a vote will be held among the current KoG members to decide whether you are suitable to join the clan. You can expect a response to your application after two weeks.

### 3.7 How can I become a moderator/tester/developer?

Please refer to the [Community Roles](/information/roles/) page to learn more about the requirements and how to apply for each role.

### 3.8 How can I create my own map and release it on KoG servers?

Firstly, please make sure you have read our [mapping guide](/guides/mapping/) *thoroughly* and fully understand the requirements for map submissions. If your map does not meet the requirements, it will be rejected right away.

Afterwards, please follow the following process to have your map released on KoG servers:

<Steps>
1. Build your map while ensuring it meets the requirements and is bug-free
2. Open the [#submit_maps](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/1033110336833847426) channel on our Discord server and attach your map
3. Wait for a channel to be created for your map and for testers to review it
4. Make any necessary changes based on the feedback you receive
5. You will be notified if your map is approved for release or rejected
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
First and foremost, maps should be enjoyable to play and be creative. If you're new to Gores, you probably lack the experience necessary to come up with parts that are interesting to play, while maintaining a consistent difficulty level throughout your map.

It is a good idea to gather more experience by playing a lot of other maps that have already been released. Try to keep track of maps that you enjoyed playing in particular and analyze what made them fun to play. This will help you understand what makes a good map and how you can improve your own maps.

At the same time you should strive to improve your own skill level. It is important to have a solid understanding of how different parts are played. This will enable you to understand how people will approach the parts that you create, and whether they are interesting to play and flow well.

Don't get discouraged if your submission is declined. Everyone can learn how to use the editor, but creating good maps that are enjoyable to play is a skill that takes time to develop. Try to learn from the feedback you receive — with enough dedication and practice, you will eventually get to play your own maps on KoG servers.
</Aside>

### 3.9 How can I suggest new features or improvements?

If you would like to suggest a new feature or improvement, you can create a new issue in [our GitHub "community" repository](https://github.com/KoG-teeworlds/community/issues).

If you do not have a Github account, you can also use the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel on our Discord server and use the button "Other" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you where you can describe your suggestion.

### 3.10 How can I contribute to KoG?

There are many ways to contribute to KoG, for example:

- You can be a good sport in-game and help other players have a good time
- You can keep an eye out for funvotes and vote no so other players get a fair chance to finish the map and don't get kicked unfairly
- You can keep an eye out for disruptive players like blockers and cheaters and vote to kick them or report them to moderators
- You can participate in our [Discord server](https://discord.kog.tw) and help other players by answering their questions
- You can [submit your own maps](/information/faq/#38-how-can-i-create-my-own-map-and-release-it-on-kog-servers) for others to play and enjoy
- You can [apply to become a tester](/information/roles/) and help us test new maps, if you meet the requirements
- You can [apply to become a moderator](/information/roles/) and help us keep the servers clean and fun for everyone
- You can [apply to become a developer](/information/roles/) and help us develop new projects and improve existing ones
- You can see our current expenses on our [funding page](https://kog.tw/#p=funding) and donate money to help us cover the server costs
- You can share your ideas and [suggest new features or improvements](/information/faq/#39-how-can-i-suggest-new-features-or-improvements) to help us make KoG even better

<Aside type="caution">
Donations help us cover the server costs and allow us to keep them online and free to play for everyone. We appreciate every donation.

However, **donations do not give you any special privileges** or advantages in-game!
</Aside>

## 4. Common issues

### 4.1 I have created a ticket in the Discord server, but I have not received a response

The moderators are providing support free-of-charge and in their free time. They are doing their best to help you, but sometimes it can take a while until they can respond to you. There are typically hundreds of open tickets at any given time, so *please be patient* and do not create multiple tickets. A moderator will respond to your ticket *as soon as possible*.

### 4.2 I cannot create an account, it says: "Please finish a map on non [A] servers first before registering."

In the server list, you can see many KoG servers that have "[A]" in the server name, but some of them do not. Join a KoG server that does NOT have "[A]" in the server name and finish a map, then try again. It is possible that you have to finish several maps before you are able to register.

### 4.3 I cannot login on the website, it says: "The data you entered is invalid! The attempt will be reported!"

Please double-check your credentials. 

If you cannot remember your password, please refer to [4.10 I cannot login on the website, I don’t remember my email or password](/information/faq/#411-i-cannot-login-on-the-website-i-dont-remember-my-email-or-password) to reset your password.

If this does not solve the issue, please use the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel on our Discord server and use the button "Other" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you. 

Open this channel and describe your issue. A moderator will respond to you as soon as possible and help you.

### 4.4 I cannot finish the migration, it says: "There is a problem within the migration! Please create a ticket on the KoG Discord and add ref... in the ticket"

Please open the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel in our Discord server and use the button "ref[number]" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you. 

Open this channel and write your ref number, for example "ref3969426", as well as your in-game name. A moderator will respond to you as soon as possible and help you.

### 4.5 I cannot proceed with the migration, it says: "Unknown error, please open a ticket on Discord to ask for a reset."

Please open the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel in our Discord server and use the button "Other" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you. 

Open this channel and ask the moderators to reset the migration for you. A moderator will respond to you as soon as possible and help you.

### 4.6 I cannot proceed with the migration, it says: "Verify your KoG One Account"

We sent a mail to your email address with a verification link. Please check your email inbox and click on the verification link to proceed with the migration.

### 4.7 I cannot proceed with the migration, I did not receive an email to verify my account

Please check your spam folder, sometimes the email ends up there. In some cases it can take up to a few hours for your email to arrive. If you still haven't received the email after a few hours, please use the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel on our Discord server and use the button "Other" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you. 

Open this channel and describe your issue. A moderator will respond to you as soon as possible and help you.

### 4.8 I cannot login on KoG servers, it says: "Your login request is now being processed."

Occasionally, when you try to login in-game using the <nobr>`/login [code]`</nobr> command, you may see the message "Your login request is now being processed." but nothing happens. Typically this issue resolves itself after a few minutes. Simply re-run the <nobr>`/login [code]`</nobr> command after a few minutes and you should be able to login eventually.

If the issue persists, you can try switching to a different KoG server. For example, if you're having issues logging into a RUS server, try logging into a GER3 server instead. This issue usually only affects one region at a time.

### 4.9 I cannot login on KoG servers, it says: "User does not exist"

Please generate a new login code by following the instructions in [4.10 I cannot login on KoG servers, I forgot my login code](/information/faq/#410-i-cannot-login-on-kog-servers-i-forgot-my-login-code). Note that it can take up to 30 minutes until the new login code works in-game. Please be patient and try again later if it does not work immediately.

### 4.10 I cannot login on KoG servers, I forgot my login code

You can generate a new login code on [our website](https://kog.tw/).

<Steps>
1. Open [kog.tw](https://kog.tw/) in your browser
2. Click on "Login" in the top right corner and sign-in
3. Click on your username in the top right corner and select "Ingame login"
4. Click on "Generate a login"
</Steps>

This will generate a new code that you can use in-game to login using the command <nobr>`/login [code]`</nobr>. You can also copy the `bind` command that is shown on the website, to set up a keybind to login with a single key press. To do this, open the console in-game by pressing `F1` and paste the command there. You can adjust the keybind by changing the character `l` to any other key.

<Aside type="caution">
It can take up to 30 minutes until the new login code works in-game. Please be patient and try again later if it does not work immediately.

Your previous login code will no longer work once you generate a new login code on the website.
</Aside>

### 4.11 I cannot login on the website, I don't remember my email or password

If you remember your email, you can use the [password reset form](https://kog.tw/reset_password.php) to reset your password.

If you do not remember your email, please use the [#create-a-ticket](https://discord.com/channels/342003344476471296/962333808189919242) channel on our Discord server and use the button "Other" to create a new ticket. This will create a new channel for you.

Open this channel and describe your issue. A moderator will respond to you as soon as possible and help you.

<Aside type="caution">
Please ensure that your new password meets these requirements:

- at most 10 characters long
- contains only letters and number
- does not contain any special characters

If you set a new password that does not meet these requirements, you will not be able to login and will have to reset the password again.

**Important:** you can only reset your password once a day. If you set a new password that does not meet the requirements, you will have to wait until the next day to reset it again or create a ticket as described above.
</Aside>

### 4.12 I cannot create a ticket on the Discord server, it says: "This interaction failed"

Please try again later. Sometimes the ticket bot is overloaded and cannot create a new ticket, but this is typically fixed after a few minutes.

### 4.13 I cannot see any "[A]" servers in the server list

Please double-check your active filters in the server list and ensure that "No login required" is not checked.

By joining the KoG servers (in-game and on Discord) you agree to follow the rules listed below.

Failure to comply with the rules will result in punishment as outlined below.

## General Rules and Expectations

1\. Moderators have discretion if something is against the rules. Don't go out looking for trouble. We don't want to have to punish anyone and we want everybody to be able to enjoy the servers. But, if you can't conduct yourself properly then we will have to take action. Actions will be taken outside the scope of these rules if deemed necessary

2a. Please be polite to each other. Obviously, people are never going to universally agree on anything, all we ask is that everyone remains courteous in your demeanour towards other players. Please refer to punishments for more info

2b. For any functional community, the members need to be able to disagree with each other. Disagreements and moderate amounts of arguing will be tolerated. However, moderators will step in and take action in cases where the conversation is crossing the line. Such as: Use of offensive language or insults, or where one individual behaves in a overly toxic fashion while the other(s) remain courteous

2c. Political Discussions: We aim to maintain a friendly and inclusive environment for all players and therefore political discussions are not allowed on the servers or in any of KoG's Discord channels. This includes any form of promoting or slandering towards political figures, parties, or ideologies

2d. The use of language that is derogatory or offensive to any particular group or individual is prohibited, including slurs based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other personal characteristic

3\. One player, One name, One account. Do not finish maps for others. Do not register more than one account. The same applied for Discord. Only one account per player is allowed

4a. The following will not be tolerated in any form: NSFW posts, Discrimination (Racism, Homophobia, Sexism etc.). messages wishing bodily harm to other players and spreading private info about other players without their consent. Any offences regarding this will not be taken lightly

4b. Sharing private information about other players without their consent (doxxing) is strictly prohibited. This behavior can put individuals at risk of harassment, stalking, or other serious harm. Any players found engaging in doxxing will be subject to permanent bans and possibly reported to authorities

## Game Rules

5a. Do not use a client that will provide you with an unfair advantage over other players. Also, do not advertise such clients to other players. In other words, do not cheat, and don’t tell other people about clients that would allow you to cheat (This includes, for example, automated advertising whispers)

5b. Do not deliberately impede other players playing. As in, do not block, "troll" or ruin for others playing the game. Of course you can have fun but make sure everyone involved is "in" on the joke before you engage in these actions

5c. Abusive vote kicks (“funvotes”) are not allowed. Players should have a legitimate reason for kicking a player. Abusing this system will result in punishments

5d. If a group is racing, do not deliberately change the map. You must wait until they either fail or finish. You can always use another server. Mistakes do happen, of course, please keep that in mind. Just look/ask before you change map

5e. There is an automated anti-cheat program present on game servers. We will generally not reverse the automated bans made by this program. See info

5f. Using any VPN/Proxy or similar services on our servers is strictly prohibited. This is to ensure security, fairness, and network stability

## Discord Rules

6a. Copypastas, irrelevant image spam, unrelated discord server links posted without mod team approval, and other disruptive (“spammy”) messages are prohibited

6b. Bot commands should, of course, remain in #⁠botspam

6c. Memes are allowed as long as they are not used excessively, and the memes themselves follow all other rules and are appropriate (PG-13). If they are off-topic to the conversation at hand, please keep them in #off-topic. (Memes concerning the KoG community can be found/posted in #⁠kog_spam_meme, with permission)

6d. Continued use of caps will be considered as spam

6e. Abide by discords TOS (https://discord.com/terms) and Community Guidelines (https://discord.com/guidelines)

6f. Alt accounts will be banned. Same goes for new members who will not participate with, or have no relation to, the KoG community. (scams, nsfw, etc)

6g. Distributing, showcasing, promoting and glorifying bot clients and/or users will not be tolerated

## Progressive Punishments

1\. We here at KoG take a strong stance against Cheating / Botting / Scripting and it is by no means allowed in any sort of way on our servers ( This includes Advertising these things) Cheating/Botting: 6 months ban -> 1 year ban -> 2 years ban -> 4 years ban -> 8 years ban.... and so on

1.1. Knowingly being dragged/carried or abusing help from a player that breaks the previous rule (Progressive punishment, Rule 1) will result in a ban (Situation dependent): 3 months ban up to 6 months ban -> 1 year ban -> 2 year ban -> 4 year ban -> 8 year ban... and so on

2\. Repetitive Discrimination (Racism, Homophobia, Sexism etc.), NSFW, Cyber bullying and other major offenses: 1 week ban -> 1 month ban -> 6 month ban -> 6 month ban

3\. Singular and/or short messages wishing bodily-harm or death to others such as "kys" messages: 2 weeks ban-> 1 month ban -> 6 months ban -> Permanent ban

4\. Repetitive Funvoting or "Gatekeeping" Servers and Maliciously targeting a specific person(s) with Funvotes -> 1 day ban -> 2 day ban -> 1 week ban -> 1 month ban

5\. Impersonating KoG members or staff: 1 day -> 2 day ban -> 1 week ban -> 1 month ban. Bans will continue to be 1 month for each time thereafter

6\. Finishing a map for another player (Using their name when crossing the finish line) -> 2 days ban -> 1 week ban -> 2 week ban -> 1 month ban -> 6 month ban

7\. Account sharing: First Offense: Warning -> Second Offense: 3-month account suspension -> Third Offense: 6-month account suspension
(Knowingly sharing account to already banned users and other special circumstances similar to that will result in harsher punishments than those listed above)

NOTE: Players will move down one "punishment level" after 6 months of consistent good behaviour. Moderators decide if a person qualifies to move down a level

## Non-progressive Punishments

1\. Malicious Spawn blocking -> 1 hour ban (Longer bans may be given under special circumstances)

2\. Impersonating registered player / Inappropriate name / Inappropriate clan -> 1d ban

3\. Name/Clan with Discrimination (Racism, Homophobia, Sexism etc.) NSFW, cyber bullying and other major offenses -> 1 day ban

4\. Singular instance of Funvote -> 3h ban

5\. Deliberately (beyond a reasonable doubt) changing the map while knowing others are racing -> 6 hour ban (Extendable depending on difficulty and length of map)

6\. Blocking at finish line, using /kill while in team or deliberately (beyond a reasonable doubt) ruining for others close to the finish -> 1 day ban (Ban length increases depending on length and difficulty of the map)

7\. Avoiding bans will reset and/or increase the punishment length in relation to the original offence, to what moderators deems fitting. (Case by case decision)

8\. Minor chat related offenses (one sided arguments and toxicity, etc) -> 1 day ban

9\. Singular instances of Discrimination (Racism, Homophobia, Sexism etc.) NSFW, etc -> 2 day ban

10\. Threats to a person safety such as Death threats, threats of violence, threats of doxxing etc. Will result in permanent ban from all of KoG and account termination. We have zero tolerance for such behaviour

NOTE: Repeat offenders will, if moderator deems it reasonable, be moved up one step on the racism / nsfw / etc punishment level

## Highlights

### New

### <Badge text="New" variant="note" /> Reworked Leaderboards
<Aside type="caution">Leaderboards are currently in early access and might not be feature complete and/or finishes might be missing on the leaderboard. **DONT** worry, all finishes are stored and will be visible at a later stage. Do **NOT** open a ticket.</Aside>

We're implementing a new tiered verification system to better represent the competitive team spirit of KoG and ensure leaderboard integrity. This update introduces four distinct verification levels that more accurately reflect the quality and accountability of recorded finishes.

A finish might be in different stages at specific times, after a period of 15 days it should be in the final stage.

#### üèÜ Verified Finish (Gold Standard)
The highest tier of verification requires:

- .teehistorian recording exists
- All players logged in (no anonymous players)
- Team play (team 0 excluded)

This ensures that verified finishes represent authentic team gameplay with full player accountability.

#### ü•à Verifiable Finish (Silver)
A solid verification level requiring:

- .teehistorian recording exists

This tier maintains good verification standards while being more accessible than the gold standard.

#### ü•â Accepted Finish (Bronze)
A basic verification level where:

- Some extent of verification is available

This tier accommodates finishes with partial verification data.

#### ‚ùì Unverified Finish
For finishes where:

- No verification information is available

These finishes remain visible but are ranked separately from verified entries.

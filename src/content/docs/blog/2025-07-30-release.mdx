## Highlights

### <Badge text="New" variant="note" /> Reworked Leaderboards
<Aside>This change is the implementation of https://github.com/orgs/KoG-teeworlds/discussions/40</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">Leaderboards are currently in early access and might not be feature complete and/or finishes might be missing on the leaderboard. **DONT** worry, all finishes are stored and will be visible at a later stage. Do **NOT** open a ticket.</Aside>

We're implementing a new tiered verification system to better represent the competitive team spirit of KoG and ensure leaderboard integrity. This update introduces four distinct verification levels that more accurately reflect the quality and accountability of recorded finishes.

A finish might be in different stages at specific times, after a period of 15 days it should be in the final stage.

#### üèÜ Verified Finish (Gold Standard)
The highest tier of verification requires:

- .teehistorian recording exists
- All players logged in (no anonymous players)
- Team play (team 0 excluded)

This ensures that verified finishes represent authentic team gameplay with full player accountability.

#### ü•à Verifiable Finish (Silver)
A solid verification level requiring:

- .teehistorian recording exists

This tier maintains good verification standards while being more accessible than the gold standard.

#### ü•â Accepted Finish (Bronze)
A basic verification level where:

- Some extent of verification is available

This tier accommodates finishes with partial verification data.

#### ‚ùì Unverified Finish
For finishes where:

- No verification information is available

These finishes remain visible but are ranked separately from verified entries.

### <Badge text="New" variant="note" /> Clans (Early Access)
We're excited to introduce the new Clan system! To ensure a stable and polished experience, we are launching this feature in a limited Early Access phase.

<Aside type="caution">
**Please note:** The Clan system is currently in a closed Early Access program and is not yet available to everyone. We are starting with a small number of selected clans to gather feedback. Our support team does not have information on a timeline for a general release.
</Aside>

#### How to Apply for Early Access
If your clan meets the requirements below, you can apply for consideration.

1.  Submit a clan request through the website.
2.  After submission, please open a support ticket to request an administrative review.

Selection is at the discretion of the administration team. As this is a closed program with limited slots, we may not be able to provide feedback on all applications.

#### Early Access Requirements
- The designated **Clan Leader** must be ranked in the Top 200 for Fixed Points.
- The application must include a list of at least **30 confirmed members**.
- The **Clan Leader** must have a clean account history on KoG with no prior punishments.

#### Clan management interface
If you are in a clan, you'll have a new menu called "Clan" in the upper right corner after you are logged in.

You are able to click on it to get redirect to the clan dashboard where you can see the current status of your clan.

Clan features are usually gray, indiciating that they are not activated. If they are blue, your clan members do have access to this certain feature.
